# OrbProp

**OrbProp** is a C++ library for orbit propagation and analysis. It provides tools to simulate and predict the motion of objects in space using various propagation models.

## Features

- Multiple orbit propagation algorithms (e.g., Keplerian, numerical integration)
- Support for different central bodies (Earth, Mars, etc.)
- Easy-to-use API for initializing and propagating orbits
- Utilities for orbital element conversion and visualization

## Installation

Clone the repository and build using CMake:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GuillermoPM/OrbProp.git
cd OrbProp
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```
